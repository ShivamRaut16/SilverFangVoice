## 🚀 Overview

**SentinelVoice AI** is a state-of-the-art communication guardian designed to preserve the semantic integrity and emotional intent of spoken language. Unlike traditional translators, it acts as a **Reasoning Bridge**, utilizing multi-pass verification to ensure that what you say is exactly what is heard—in any language.

### Key Modes:
- **Snapshot Mode**: Deep reasoning and multi-pass semantic verification for complex phrases.
- **Live Neural Link**: Low-latency, real-time audio translation for seamless conversations.

## ✨ Features

- **Intent Preservation**: Analyzes emotional tone and functional goals to keep meanings accurate.
- **Semantic Grounding**: Uses deep search (Gemini Grounding) to verify cultural idioms and facts in real-time.
- **Safety Analysis**: Built-in risk evaluation engine that identifies potential harm or ambiguity.
- **Neural TTS**: High-fidelity voice synthesis via Gemini and ElevenLabs.
- **Glassmorphic UI**: A premium, responsive dashboard designed for high-end professional use.
